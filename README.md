## How to contribute

**0)** The route **must** be a "**currently-running**" "**bus route**" in "**Beijing**".

**1)** Make sure the route is not included in the project or it demands update.

**2)** **Fork** this repo.

**3)** You can import or edit [/model/model_generate.py](model/model_generate.py) and fill in the infomation of your route, then generate a new JSON file for your route.

**4)** Submit a new **Pull Request** with your modification and **a photograph of the board of the route** as appendix. Photos **must** be taken **recently** and **by yourself**(rather than a copy from Internet).

If you have questions about this project, please submit a new **Issue**, thanks.
